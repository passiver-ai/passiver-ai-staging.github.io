Other fermented foods like doenjang (soybean paste) and gochujang (red chili paste) are also widely used in Korean cooking.

Korean cuisine is also known for its love of spicy flavors. Gochujang, a fermented chili paste, is a key ingredient in many Korean dishes and adds a unique depth of flavor and spiciness.
