## Introduction to Korean Vegetarian Cuisine

Korean vegetarian cuisine, also known as temple food, is a unique culinary tradition deeply influenced by Buddhism. It not only emphasizes natural and healthy meals but also holds spiritual significance for practitioners of Buddha-dharma. In this blog post, we will explore the characteristics of Korean temple food and its numerous health benefits.

### The Influence of Buddhism on Korean Vegetarian Food

One of the fundamental principles in Buddhism is compassion for all living beings. This principle extends to the dietary choices followed by practitioners, which has greatly shaped Korean vegetarian cuisine. The belief that eating meat extinguishes the seeds of compassion leads to the exclusion of animal products from Korean temple food, except for dairy.

In addition to avoiding meat consumption, monks and nuns traditionally abstain from consuming pungent vegetables such as onions, garlic, chives, green onions, and leeks. This practice aims to prevent distractions during meditation and attachment to strong flavors that may disturb spiritual practice.

Furthermore, Korean temple food relies on natural seasonings and flavor enhancers instead of artificial flavors. A variety of mountain herbs and wild greens are incorporated into dishes rather than relying solely on processed condiments. Natural seasonings such as mushroom powder, kelp powder, jae-pi powder (made from roasted sesame leaves), perilla seed powder (made from roasted perilla seeds), and uncooked bean powder are used both for nutritional balance correction and enhancing flavors.

Another significant aspect of Buddhist influence on Korean vegetarian cuisine is the prominence given to fermented foods. Fermentation not only adds savory flavors but also offers numerous health benefits such as lowering cholesterol levels, inhibiting cancer growths,and protecting against age-related illnesses.Fermented foods commonly found in Korean temples include kimchi (fermented cabbage or radish), soy sauce,
soybean paste (doenjang), red pepper paste (gochujang), vinegar,rice punch,misugaru (a mixed grain powder), and pine needle tea.

Preservation techniques have also been developed by monks and nuns to ensure a year-round supply of vegetables and plants. Kimchi, one of the most well-known examples of preserved food, is made by fermenting vegetables with spices. Additionally, various other methods such as preserving vegetables in soy sauce, red pepper paste, vinegar, salt,and salted vegetables are employed. These preserved foods can be stored for long periods without losing their nutritional value,making them an important source of essential nutrients during the winter months when fresh produce may be scarce.

### The Health Benefits of a Korean Vegetarian Diet

1. Abundant Natural Fiber:
Korean temple food consists of an assortment of vegetables and greens that are rich in natural fiber.This dietary composition promotes healthy digestion and contributes to overall gut health.Fiber helps regulate bowel movements,reduces the risk of constipation,and supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

2. Low Cholesterol:
Contrary to popular belief that vegetarian diets may lack proper nutrition,Korean temple food provides all necessary nutrients while being low in cholesterol.The absenceof meat and inclusionof plant-based protein sources contribute to a heart-healthy diet choice for individuals concerned about their cardiovascular health.
 
3.Nutrient-Rich:
Korean temple food offers a wide range of essential nutrients derived from various plant-based ingredients.It provides a balanced combination of vitamins,minerals,and antioxidants necessary for maintaining good health.Some notable ingredients commonly found in Korean vegetarian cuisine include soybeans,tofu,wild mushrooms,nuts,various grains,and leafy greens-all packed with vital nutrients.
 
4.Age-Related Health Benefits:
The consumption of Korean temple food has shown potential benefits in preventing age-related health problems.Due to its emphasis on natural,responsibly-sourced ingredients,it can help reduce inflammation levels within the body.This leads to improved immune function,reduced risk factors relatedto chronic diseases,and an overall enhancement of well-being. Additionally, the inclusion of fermented and preserved foods in the diet can support a healthy gut microbiome,which plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal health as we age.

### Sigeumchi Namul Preparation Tricks from Korean Chefs

Sigeumchi Namul is a popular Korean seasoned spinach side dish that is flavorful and nutritious. Here are some preparation tricks from Korean chefs:

1. Blanching method: Bring water to a boil in a large pot or deep skillet. Add washed spinach leaves (stems removed) and cook them for about 1-2 minutes until they become bright green but still retain their crispness.

2. Ice bath shock: After blanching, immediately transfer the cooked spinach leaves into an ice bath (bowl filled with cold water & ice cubes). This will help preserve their vibrant green color while stopping further cooking process due to residual heat.

3a) Draining excess moisture:
Remove cooled spinach from ice bath using tongs or slotted spoon; gently squeeze out excess moisture by hand without overdoing it - be gentle! Alternatively, use paper towels/ clean kitchen towel to blot away moisture carefully.

3b) Cutting / shredding:
Place drained spinach on cutting board; chop crosswise into bite-sized pieces OR leave them long like noodle strands depending on personal preference/recipe requirements.
 
4. Seasoning mixture: In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic cloves (or garlic powder), sugar (or alternative sweeteners), toasted sesame seeds for added nuttiness.

5. Combine everything:
Transfer the drained spinach to a mixing bowl and pour the prepared seasoning mixture over it. Toss gently but thoroughly until each piece of spinach is well-coated with flavors from the seasoning.

6. Marinating time: Allow Sigeumchi Namul to marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or longer (up to several hours) before serving - this will allow the flavors to penetrate deeper into the spinach leaves.

7. Serve chilled or at room temperature: Once marinated as per desired taste intensity, transfer your Sigeumchi Namul to a serving dish and enjoy it as a refreshing side dish alongside other Korean dishes!

Now you can prepare this delicious Korean seasoned spinach side dish just like professional chefs!
