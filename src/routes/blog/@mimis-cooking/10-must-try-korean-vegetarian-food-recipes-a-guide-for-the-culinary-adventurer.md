## Introduction to Korean Vegetarian Cuisine

Korean vegetarian cuisine, also known as temple food, is a unique culinary tradition deeply influenced by Buddhism. It not only emphasizes natural and healthy meals but also holds spiritual significance for practitioners of Buddha-dharma. In this blog post, we will explore the characteristics of Korean temple food and its numerous health benefits.

### The Influence of Buddhism on Korean Vegetarian Food

One of the fundamental principles in Buddhism is compassion for all living beings. This principle extends to the dietary choices followed by practitioners, which has greatly shaped Korean vegetarian cuisine. The belief that eating meat extinguishes the seeds of compassion leads to the exclusion of animal products from Korean temple food, except for dairy.

In addition to avoiding meat consumption, monks and nuns traditionally abstain from consuming pungent vegetables such as onions, garlic, chives, green onions, and leeks. This practice aims to prevent distractions during meditation and attachment to strong flavors that may disturb spiritual practice.

Furthermore, Korean temple food relies on natural seasonings and flavor enhancers instead of artificial flavors. A variety of mountain herbs and wild greens are incorporated into dishes rather than relying solely on processed condiments. Natural seasonings such as mushroom powder, kelp powder, jae-pi powder (made from roasted sesame leaves), perilla seed powder (made from roasted perilla seeds), and uncooked bean powder are used both for nutritional balance correction and enhancing flavors.

Another significant aspect of Buddhist influence on Korean vegetarian cuisine is the prominence given to fermented foods. Fermentation not only adds savory flavors but also offers numerous health benefits such as lowering cholesterol levels, inhibiting cancer growths,and protecting against age-related illnesses.Fermented foods commonly found in Korean temples include kimchi (fermented cabbage or radish), soy sauce,
soybean paste (doenjang), red pepper paste (gochujang), vinegar,rice punch,misugaru (a mixed grain powder), and pine needle tea.

Preservation techniques have also been developed by monks and nuns to ensure a year-round supply of vegetables and plants. Kimchi, one of the most well-known examples of preserved food, is made by fermenting vegetables with spices. Additionally, various other methods such as preserving vegetables in soy sauce, red pepper paste, vinegar, salt,and salted vegetables are employed. These preserved foods can be stored for long periods without losing their nutritional value,making them an important source of essential nutrients during the winter months when fresh produce may be scarce.

### The Health Benefits of a Korean Vegetarian Diet

1. Abundant Natural Fiber:
Korean temple food consists of an assortment of vegetables and greens that are rich in natural fiber.This dietary composition promotes healthy digestion and contributes to overall gut health.Fiber helps regulate bowel movements,reduces the risk of constipation,and supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

2. Low Cholesterol:
Contrary to popular belief that vegetarian diets may lack proper nutrition,Korean temple food provides all necessary nutrients while being low in cholesterol.The absenceof meat and inclusionof plant-based protein sources contribute to a heart-healthy diet choice for individuals concerned about their cardiovascular health.
 
3.Nutrient-Rich:
Korean temple food offers a wide range of essential nutrients derived from various plant-based ingredients.It provides a balanced combination of vitamins,minerals,and antioxidants necessary for maintaining good health.Some notable ingredients commonly found in Korean vegetarian cuisine include soybeans,tofu,wild mushrooms,nuts,various grains,and leafy greens-all packed with vital nutrients.
 
4.Age-Related Health Benefits:
The consumption of Korean temple food has shown potential benefits in preventing age-related health problems.Due to its emphasis on natural,responsibly-sourced ingredients,it can help reduce inflammation levels within the body.This leads to improved immune function,reduced risk factors relatedto chronic diseases,and an overall enhancement of well-being. Additionally, the inclusion of fermented and preserved foods in the diet can support a healthy gut microbiome,which plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal health as we age.

### Sigeumchi Namul Preparation Tricks from Korean Chefs

Sigeumchi Namul is a popular Korean seasoned spinach side dish that is flavorful and nutritious. Here are some preparation tricks from Korean chefs:

1. Blanching method: Bring water to a boil in a large pot or deep skillet. Add washed spinach leaves (stems removed) and cook them for about 1-2 minutes until they become bright green but still retain their crispness.

2. Ice bath shock: After blanching, immediately transfer the cooked spinach leaves into an ice bath (bowl filled with cold water & ice cubes). This will help preserve their vibrant green color while stopping further cooking process due to residual heat.

3a) Draining excess moisture:
Remove cooled spinach from ice bath using tongs or slotted spoon; gently squeeze out excess moisture by hand without overdoing it - be gentle! Alternatively, use paper towels/ clean kitchen towel to blot away moisture carefully.

3b) Cutting / shredding:
Place drained spinach on cutting board; chop crosswise into bite-sized pieces OR leave them long like noodle strands depending on personal preference/recipe requirements.
 
4. Seasoning mixture: In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic cloves (or garlic powder), sugar (or alternative sweeteners), toasted sesame seeds for added nuttiness.

5. Combine everything:
Transfer the drained spinach to a mixing bowl and pour the prepared seasoning mixture over it. Toss gently but thoroughly until each piece of spinach is well-coated with flavors from the seasoning.

6. Marinating time: Allow Sigeumchi Namul to marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or longer (up to several hours) before serving - this will allow the flavors to penetrate deeper into the spinach leaves.

7. Serve chilled or at room temperature: Once marinated as per desired taste intensity, transfer your Sigeumchi Namul to a serving dish and enjoy it as a refreshing side dish alongside other Korean dishes!

Now you can prepare this delicious Korean seasoned spinach side dish just like professional chefs!

## Pairing Korean Vegetarian Food with Drinks

Korean cuisine is known for its bold flavors, rich spices, and diverse range of dishes. While many traditional Korean dishes are meat-based, there are also plenty of delicious options for vegetarians to enjoy. In this blog post, we will explore the art of pairing Korean vegetarian food with drinks, specifically focusing on Soju and non-alcoholic beverage options. Whether you're a vegetarian or simply looking to try something new, these pairings will enhance your dining experience and take your taste buds on a delightful journey.

### Choosing the Right Soju for Your Dishes

Soju is an integral part of Korean drinking culture. It is a clear distilled liquor that has been enjoyed by Koreans for centuries. When it comes to pairing Soju with vegetarian food, it's essential to choose the right type of Soju that complements the flavors of your dishes.

3. **Premium Andong Soju:** For those who appreciate more complex flavors and enjoy sipping their drinks slowly while savoring each bite, Premium Andong Soju is an excellent choice. Made from traditional methods using glutinous rice fermentation processes passed down through generations in Andong city (a famous region for producing high-quality sojus), this premium version adds depth and sophistication to your dining experience.

4. **Craft Sojus:** Craft sojus are gaining popularity in Korea, offering unique flavors and higher alcohol content. These artisanal sojus often incorporate natural ingredients like honey or botanicals, providing a distinct taste profile that can elevate the flavors of your vegetarian dishes. Pair them with hearty vegetable stews or spicy tofu for a memorable combination.

5. **Aged Soju:** If you're looking for something truly special to complement your vegetarian feast, aged soju might be just what you need. Aged in traditional clay pots for an extended period, these premium versions of soju develop complex flavors reminiscent of whiskey or brandy. Sip on aged soju while enjoying grilled mushrooms or vegetable jeon (pancakes) for a luxurious experience.

### Non-Alcoholic Beverage Options in Korea

For those who prefer non-alcoholic beverages or want to enjoy Korean cuisine without alcohol, there are also plenty of options available in Korea that pair well with vegetarian food.

It is low in alcohol content and pairs exceptionally well with vegetarian street foods such as hotteok (sweet pancakes filled with cinnamon sugar) or bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes). The mild sweetness and fizzy texture create a delightful contrast when enjoyed alongside savory plant-based dishes.

2. **Bori-cha:** Bori-cha is roasted barley tea commonly served as a cold beverage during summer months in Korea but can be enjoyed year-round as well. This caffeine-free herbal tea has nutty undertones and helps cleanse the palate between bites of flavorful vegetarian dishes like kimchi jjigae (kimchi stew) or doenjang jjigae (soybean paste stew).

3 .**Sikhye:** Sikhye is a traditional sweet rice beverage that is often served as a dessert or digestive aid. It has a refreshing and slightly effervescent quality, making it an ideal accompaniment to rich and spicy vegetarian dishes such as yubuchobap (stuffed tofu) or dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried vegetables). The subtle sweetness of sikhye balances out the spiciness and adds a touch of indulgence to your meal.

4. **Yuja-cha:** Yuja-cha, also known as yuzu tea, is made from the citrus fruit called yuja. This aromatic tea has a tangy yet floral flavor that pairs well with Korean vegetable side dishes like namul (seasoned greens) or banchan (assorted small plates). Enjoy a cup of warm yuja-cha alongside your vegetarian feast for an invigorating burst of flavors.

5. **Barley Sujeonggwa:** Sujeonggwa is a traditional Korean punch made from cinnamon, ginger, persimmons, and dried jujubes. Barley sujeonggwa replaces sugar with barley malt syrup for those who prefer healthier alternatives without compromising taste.
